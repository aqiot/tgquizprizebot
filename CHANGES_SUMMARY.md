# Bot Updates Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Updated Welcome Message (/start command)
**Location:** `bot/bot.js` lines 21-44

**Changes:**
- Added localization support for Russian (ru) and English (default for others)
- Russian message: "–ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç! –î–æ–±—Ä–æ –ø–æ–∂–∞–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –≤ –ö–≤–∏–∑—ã —Å –ø—Ä–∏–∑–∞–º–∏. –ü—Ä–æ—Ö–æ–¥–∏ –∫–≤–∏–∑—ã –∫–∞–∂–¥—É—é –Ω–µ–¥–µ–ª—é –∏ —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–≤—É–π –≤ —Ä–æ–∑—ã–≥—Ä—ã—à–∞—Ö. –°–∫–æ—Ä–µ–µ –Ω–∞—á–∏–Ω–∞–π!"
- English message: "Hey, welcome to Quizzes with Prizes. Complete the quizzes every week and participate in the Giveaways. Open app to start"
- Added inline keyboard button that opens `t.me/tgquizprizebot/app`
- Button text is also localized: "üéÆ –û—Ç–∫—Ä—ã—Ç—å –ø—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ" (RU) / "üéÆ Open App" (EN)

### 2. Removed Reply Keyboards
**Locations:** 
- `bot/bot.js` line 36-41 (removed from /start command)
- `bot/bot.js` line 80-83 (removed force_reply from /createcampaign)

**Changes:**
- Removed the persistent reply keyboard that showed command buttons
- Removed force_reply from campaign creation flow
- Users now interact through inline keyboards and direct commands only

### 3. Updated Campaign Link Generation
**Location:** `server.js` lines 260-272

**Changes:**
- Campaign links now use the format: `t.me/tgquizprizebot/app?startapp={campaignID}`
- Removed base64 encoding of campaign ID
- Campaign ID is now passed directly as the startapp parameter
- This allows the link to directly open the webapp with the campaign identifier

**Additional Updates:**
- Updated the success message in `bot/bot.js` (lines 192-214) to clarify that the link opens the webapp directly
- Updated help text to reflect the new functionality

## How It Works Now

1. **Start Command**: When users send `/start`, they receive a localized welcome message with a button to open the quiz webapp directly.

2. **Campaign Creation**: The `/createcampaign` command now:
   - Asks for a campaign ID (without force reply)
   - Generates a link in format: `t.me/tgquizprizebot/app?startapp={campaignID}`
   - The campaign ID is passed directly without encoding

3. **User Experience**: 
   - No persistent keyboards cluttering the interface
   - Clean inline buttons for navigation
   - Direct webapp links with campaign tracking

## Testing

A test script has been created at `test_changes.js` to verify the campaign link generation works correctly.

To test:
1. Start the server: `node server.js`
2. Run the test: `node test_changes.js`
